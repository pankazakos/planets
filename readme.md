## Planets
### Description

This is an OpenGL app that renders Sun, Earth and Moon objects in a 3d scene. The Earth is moving around the Sun and rotating around itself, while the Moon is moving around the Earth. All rotations are counterclockwise. There is also lighting coming from the Sun which is reflected by the Earth and the Moon using [phong shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading). There is also a slight ambient lighting in the scene.
